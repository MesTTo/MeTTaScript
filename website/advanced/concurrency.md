# Concurrency and transactions

Once grounded operations can do [asynchronous I/O](/typescript/async), you can compose them concurrently. MeTTaScript adds a small set of TypeScript-native concurrency primitives and a transaction form. They are opt-in: bring them in with `(import! &self concurrency)`.

## par: run branches concurrently

`par` evaluates its branches concurrently and unions their results. With async operations, the whole thing takes about as long as the slowest branch, not the sum. Here `aw n` is an async operation that resolves to `n` after an `n`-millisecond delay:

```ts twoslash
import { runProgramAsync, format, gint, type AsyncGroundFn } from "@mettascript/core";

const aw: AsyncGroundFn = async (args) => {
  const a = args[0]!;
  const n = a.kind === "gnd" && a.value.g === "int" ? a.value.n : 0;
  await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, Number(n)));
  return { tag: "ok", results: [gint(n)] };
};

const out = await runProgramAsync("!(collapse (par (aw 3) (aw 4) (aw 2)))", new Map([["aw", aw]]));
console.log(out.at(-1)!.results.map(format)); // [ '(, 3 4 2)' ]
```

Branch effects (atoms added to a space) are merged back deterministically as a multiset delta, so `par` of three `add-atom`s yields all three additions regardless of finishing order.

## race and once

`race` returns the first branch to produce a result and cancels the losers through an `AbortSignal`, so a cancelled branch's effects never land:

```ts twoslash
import { runProgramAsync, format, gint, type AsyncGroundFn } from "@mettascript/core";
const aw: AsyncGroundFn = async (args) => {
  const a = args[0]!;
  const n = a.kind === "gnd" && a.value.g === "int" ? a.value.n : 0;
  await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, Number(n)));
  return { tag: "ok", results: [gint(n)] };
};
const ops = new Map([["aw", aw]]);
// ---cut---
await runProgramAsync("!(race (aw 40) (aw 3))", new Map([["aw", aw]]));
// the 3 ms branch wins -> [ '3' ]
```

`once` cuts a nondeterministic computation down to its first result. Unlike `par` and `race`, it does not need async and works synchronously too.

## hyperpose: parallel branches across CPU cores

`par` and `race` overlap _asynchronous_ work on a single thread; they cannot speed up pure CPU work, because a branch that compiles to a tight native loop runs to completion without ever yielding. `hyperpose` covers that case. On its own, `(hyperpose (b1 b2 …))` behaves like `superpose`, yielding each branch as a nondeterministic result. But `(once (hyperpose …))` is special: on Node it evaluates the branches in parallel worker threads and returns the first to finish.

That is exactly what you want when the branches are CPU-bound and you only need one answer. Suppose you are checking several large numbers for primality and only one of them is cheap:

```metta
!(once (hyperpose ((prime? 535372570000000063)    ; expensive
                   (prime? 537818110000000001)    ; expensive
                   (prime? 5421844300001)         ; cheap
                   (prime? 547344310000000013)))) ; expensive
; -> True, returned as soon as the cheap branch finishes
```

Run sequentially, the engine would grind through the first expensive check before it ever reached the cheap one. With workers the cheap branch settles first, `once` returns immediately, and the rest are cancelled.

Each worker re-evaluates its branch from the program's rules, so the parallel path applies when the branches are pure and ground (they read no atoms added during the run). Otherwise, and in the browser, which has no worker threads, `(once (hyperpose …))` falls back to evaluating the branches in sequence: the same results, just without the parallelism.

## with-mutex: serialize a critical section

`with-mutex` takes a key and a body, and serializes bodies sharing the same key, so concurrent branches enter the critical section one at a time. Use it when several async branches touch the same external resource and must not interleave.

```ts twoslash
import { runProgramAsync, format, gint, type AsyncGroundFn } from "@mettascript/core";
const aw: AsyncGroundFn = async (args) => {
  const a = args[0]!;
  const n = a.kind === "gnd" && a.value.g === "int" ? a.value.n : 0;
  await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, Number(n)));
  return { tag: "ok", results: [gint(n)] };
};
const ops = new Map([["aw", aw]]);
// ---cut---
// Two branches both update "account"; with-mutex makes them run one after the other.
await runProgramAsync(
  `!(par (with-mutex account (deposit 10))
         (with-mutex account (deposit 20)))`,
  ops,
);
// the deposits apply in series, never interleaved
```

## transactions

`transaction` evaluates its body and commits the body's space mutations only on success. If the body throws an `(Error ...)` atom or produces zero results, the world is rolled back (a snapshot/restore of the copy-on-write space, not an undo log). This one is synchronous, so it runs in the sandbox below. Press **Run**:

<MettaRunner>

```metta
!(import! &self concurrency)
!(add-atom &self (cnt 5))

; the body adds (cnt 7) and returns a value -> committed
!(transaction (add-atom &self (cnt 7)))

; the body adds (cnt 6) then yields zero results -> rolled back
!(transaction (let $u (add-atom &self (cnt 6)) (superpose ())))

!(collapse (match &self (cnt $v) $v))
```

</MettaRunner>

The final query shows `(, 5 7)`: the committed `(cnt 7)` is there, and the rolled-back `(cnt 6)` is gone.

## What these are and are not

Most of these give deterministic, STM-style isolation and ordering on top of asynchronous I/O: `par`, `race`, `with-mutex`, and `transaction` are concurrency (overlapping I/O) on a single thread, not parallelism across CPU cores. `hyperpose` is the exception: `(once (hyperpose …))` uses worker threads for genuine cross-core parallelism on Node. For data-parallel matching across cores, see [scaling](/advanced/scaling) and the worker-thread matcher.
