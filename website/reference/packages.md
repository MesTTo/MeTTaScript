# Packages

MeTTa TS is a small set of packages under the `@metta-ts` scope. Install only what you need; everything builds on the core. For the full API of each, see the detailed reference: [core](/reference/core), [hyperon](/reference/hyperon), [edsl](/reference/edsl), and [node and browser](/reference/node-browser).

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`@metta-ts/core`](https://github.com/MesTTo/Meta-TypeScript-Talk/tree/main/packages/core)               | The interpreter, parser, type system, and standard library. Zero platform dependencies, runs in any JavaScript runtime.                             |
| [`@metta-ts/hyperon`](https://github.com/MesTTo/Meta-TypeScript-Talk/tree/main/packages/hyperon)         | A TypeScript class API over the core (atoms, spaces, grounded operations).                                                                          |
| [`@metta-ts/edsl`](https://github.com/MesTTo/Meta-TypeScript-Talk/tree/main/packages/edsl)               | An ergonomic, typed eDSL: term builders, special-form combinators, and a tagged template.                                                           |
| [`@metta-ts/node`](https://github.com/MesTTo/Meta-TypeScript-Talk/tree/main/packages/node)               | The `metta-ts` CLI, file `import!`, and the `SharedArrayBuffer` worker-thread parallel matcher.                                                     |
| [`@metta-ts/browser`](https://github.com/MesTTo/Meta-TypeScript-Talk/tree/main/packages/browser)         | Browser entry point with an in-memory virtual file system for `import!`.                                                                            |
| [`@metta-ts/py`](https://github.com/MesTTo/Meta-TypeScript-Talk/tree/main/packages/py)                   | Python interop: PeTTa's `py-call` and Hyperon's `py-atom` over a caller-supplied bridge (pythonia). Opt-in, async, no Python dependency of its own. |
| [`@metta-ts/grapher`](https://github.com/MesTTo/Meta-TypeScript-Talk/tree/main/packages/grapher)         | MeTTaGrapher: a pure-SVG visual editor that draws a program as a node graph or nested blocks and runs it on the core.                               |
| [`@metta-ts/das-client`](https://github.com/MesTTo/Meta-TypeScript-Talk/tree/main/packages/das-client)   | Client for SingularityNET's Distributed AtomSpace.                                                                                                  |
| [`@metta-ts/das-gateway`](https://github.com/MesTTo/Meta-TypeScript-Talk/tree/main/packages/das-gateway) | A transport-agnostic gateway bridging the browser to a Distributed AtomSpace.                                                                       |

## How they fit together

`@metta-ts/core` is the whole language: parse, evaluate, match, type-check, and the standard library. If you only want to run MeTTa, this is all you need.

`@metta-ts/hyperon` and `@metta-ts/edsl` are two TypeScript-facing layers over the core. The hyperon package mirrors the Python API (a `MeTTa` runner, `S`/`V`/`E`/`G` atom constructors, grounded operations). The eDSL is the more idiomatic, typed way to build and run MeTTa from TypeScript.

`@metta-ts/node` and `@metta-ts/browser` are platform entry points: the Node package adds the CLI, file imports, and the worker-thread matcher; the browser package adds an in-memory file system. Both re-export the core.

`@metta-ts/grapher` is the visual editor, [MeTTaGrapher](/tools/grapher). It renders a program as a node graph or nested blocks and runs it on the core, so it is a view over atoms rather than a second engine; anything that produces atoms, including the eDSL, feeds it.

`@metta-ts/py` is optional, for calling Python from a MeTTa program. It reaches CPython through a caller-supplied bridge and runs asynchronously, so the interpreter itself stays pure TypeScript. See [Python interop](/typescript/python-interop).

`@metta-ts/das-client` and `@metta-ts/das-gateway` are optional, for querying a remote Distributed AtomSpace.
